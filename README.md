# Stock-Agregator
- Uses Python's yahoo_fin module and coinbasepro module to gather data on specific stock tickers.
- Allows the user to specify what tickers they want and lets them add other tickers, including cryptocurrency.
- Also allows the user to just get the symbols and prices of the top stocks and cryptocurrency through web scraping certain websites
- Both of these options can either be exported to a spreadsheet or text file.
# To Do
- Gather the most talked about tickers from r/wallstreetbets and r/stocks, gather that into a list and input it into the program
